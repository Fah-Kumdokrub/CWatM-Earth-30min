WATCH+WFDEI - Rhine
-----------

Daily-resolution observed climate data on  (land only) 0.5°x0.5° lat-lon grid, 
HERE: Only for the Rhine catchment

based on the reanalysis data set ERA-Interim and using the bias target GPCC. 
The data set covers the period 1901-2012, where the data for 1901-1978 are taken from WFD, and from 1979 onwards from WFDEI.GPCC


Data Type: Daily observed atmospheric climate
Variables: 
tavg: Avg. Temperature [K]
pr: precipitation (snowfall + rain)  [kg m-2 s-1]
ET_Ref: Potential reference evapotranspiration rate (Penman–Monteith equations)
EW_ref: Potential evaporation rate from water surface ( Penman–Monteith equations)


HERE: a dataset from 1/1/1961- 31/12/2010 with each parameter in a single netcdf file.
